## Parameters
- `sequence`: a series of numbers that specify the ordering of assignments in the threading or treadling. In this case, only one assignment can be applied to each pic or end in the threading/treadling. For example, if you input: 

` 0 1 2 3 2 1`

and select "treadling" will create a draft of 3 rows/frames high and 9 warps long. the first warp will be assigned frame 0 (which means it will be empty), the second warp will be assigned to frame 1, third to frame 2 and so on  


-  `orientation`: determines if you would like to create a threading or treadling sequence (or both).

## Application
This can be helpful for creating long an non-repeating threading sequences to apply to projects or for creating profile drafting block units from number sequences.

## Tip
You can attach this draft to "make drawdown from threading, tieup and treadling" to compose a drawdown using the information generated.
