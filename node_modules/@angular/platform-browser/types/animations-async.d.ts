/**
 * Returns the set of dependency-injection providers
 * to enable animations in an application. See [animations guide](guide/animations)
 * to learn more about animations in Angular.
 *
 * When you use this function instead of the eager `provideAnimations()`, animations won't be
 * rendered until the renderer is loaded.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The function is useful when you want to enable animations in an application
 * bootstrapped using the `bootstrapApplication` function. In this scenario there
 * is no need to import the `BrowserAnimationsModule` NgModule at all, just add
 * providers returned by this function to the `providers` list as show below.
 *
 * ```ts
 * bootstrapApplication(RootComponent, {
 *   providers: [
 *     provideAnimationsAsync()
 *   ]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @param type pass `'noop'` as argument to disable animations.
 *
 * @publicApi
 *
 * @deprecated 20.2 Use `animate.enter` or `animate.leave` instead. Intent to remove in v23
