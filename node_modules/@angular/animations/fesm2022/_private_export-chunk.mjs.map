This is also the case for when a sub animation is\n * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.\n *\n * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled\n * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation\n * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides\n * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,\n * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.\n *\n * @publicApi\n *\n * @deprecated 20.2 Use `animate.enter` or `animate.leave` instead.

a string with a specific syntax\n *  - or a function that compares the previous and current state (value of the expression bound to\n *    the element's trigger) and returns `true` if the transition should occur or `false` otherwise\n *\n * The string format can be:\n *  - `fromState => toState`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur then the\n *    expression bound to the trigger's element goes from `fromState` to `toState`\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```ts\n *        transition('open => closed', animate('.5s ease-out', style({ height: 0 }) ))\n *      ```\n *\n *  - `fromState <=> toState`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur then\n *    the expression bound to the trigger's element goes from `fromState` to `toState` or vice versa\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```ts\n *        transition('enabled <=> disabled', animate('1s cubic-bezier(0.8,0.3,0,1)'))\n *      ```\n *\n *  - `:enter`/`:leave`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur when the\n *    element enters or exists the DOM\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```ts\n *        transition(':enter', [\n *          style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *          animate('500ms', style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *        ])\n *      ```\n *\n *  - `:increment`/`:decrement`, which indicates that the transition's animations should occur when\n *    the numerical expression bound to the trigger's element has increased in value or decreased\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```ts\n *        transition(':increment', query('@counter', animateChild()))\n *      ```\n *\n *  - a sequence of any of the above divided by commas, which indicates that transition's animations\n *    should occur whenever one of the state change expressions matches\n *\n *    _Example:_\n *      ```ts\n *        transition(':increment, * => enabled, :enter', animate('1s ease', keyframes([\n *          style({ transform: 'scale(1)', offset: 0}),\n *          style({ transform: 'scale(1.1)', offset: 0.7}),\n *          style({ transform: 'scale(1)', offset: 1})\n *        ]))),\n *      ```\n *\n * Also note that in such context:\n *  - `void` can be used to indicate the absence of the element\n *  - asterisks can be used as wildcards that match any state\n *  - (as a consequence of the above, `void => *` is equivalent to `:enter` and `* => void` is\n *    equivalent to `:leave`)\n *  - `true` and `false` also match expression values of `1` and `0` respectively (but do not match\n *    _truthy_ and _falsy_ values)\n *\n * <div class=\"docs-alert docs-alert-helpful\">\n *\n *  Be careful about entering end leaving elements as their transitions present a common\n *  pitfall for developers.\n *\n *  Note that when an element with a trigger enters the DOM its `:enter` transition always\n *  gets executed, but its `:leave` transition will not be executed if the element is removed\n *  alongside its parent (as it will be removed \"without warning\" before its transition has\n *  a chance to be executed, the only way that such transition can occur is if the element\n *  is exiting the DOM on its own).\n *\n *\n * </div>\n *\n * ### Animating to a Final State\n *\n * If the final step in a transition is a call to `animate()` that uses a timing value\n * with no `style` data, that step is automatically considered the final animation arc,\n * for the element to reach the final state, in such case Angular automatically adds or removes\n * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.\n *\n *\n * ### Usage Examples\n *\n *  - Transition animations applied based on\n *    the trigger's expression value\n *\n *   ```html\n *   <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">\n *    ...\n *   </div>\n *   ```\n *\n *   ```ts\n *   trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *     ..., // states\n *     transition(\"on => off, open => closed\", animate(500)),\n *     transition(\"* <=> error\", query('.indicator', animateChild()))\n *   ])\n *   ```\n *\n *  - Transition animations applied based on custom logic dependent\n *    on the trigger's expression value and provided parameters\n *\n *    ```html\n *    <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"{\n *     value: stepName,\n *     params: { target: currentTarget }\n *    }\">\n *     ...\n *    </div>\n *    ```\n *\n *    ```ts\n *    trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *      ..., // states\n *      transition(\n *        (fromState, toState, _element, params) =>\n *          ['firststep', 'laststep'].includes(fromState.toLowerCase())\n *          && toState === params?.['target'],\n *        animate('1s')\n *      )\n *    ])\n *    ```\n *\n * @publicApi\n *\n * @deprecated 20.2 Use `animate.enter` or `animate.leave` instead.
