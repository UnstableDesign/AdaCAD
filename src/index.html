  <h1 style="display: none;">AdaCAD is an experimental deisgn tool for experimental weavers. It applies the workflows of parametric design to weave drafting. Parametric design is a form of design that creates dataflows between different parameterized operations that generate new outputs, in this case, weave drafts. Changing the parameters and/or elements within the dataflow directly changes the outcome. To put it another way, parametric design has you create and connect together different operations that result in drafts, rather than describing each pixel within a structure directly. While the software caters to the styles and patterns often used by complex and/or jacquard weavers, it also offers features to support weaving on frame, dobby, and direct tie looms. AdaCAD is Free Software created by the Unstable Design Lab with support from National Science Foundation Grants #1755587 and #1943109.
