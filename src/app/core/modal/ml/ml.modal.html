      <p class ="mat-body">To get started using machine learning, all you have to do is choose your weaving style. Our current version of ML is only using German and Crackle Weave drafts at this time. To start using machine learning, all you have to do is click "Start Mixed Initiative"(add  visualization). The Start Mixed Initiative mode was made so all you have to do is click 'Start Mixed Initiative,' which initiates a comparison between your draft and the drafts of your selected style. Once a draft similar to your design is found, this draft will be used as a seed for the machine learning model to generate an original draft as a suggestion. After starting Mixed Initiative mode there will be a variety of drafts suggested to you to pick from (add  visualization). If you like a suggested draft you can click on the draft to be able to use it in your own draft! When you are done using this tool all you have to do is click on “Stop Mixed Initiative” (add  visualization). By clicking “Stop Mixed Initiative” you will no longer be using our machine learning when the mixed initiative mode is not engaged.</a></p>
