When embedding variables within the HTML files, always include as variables (never functions). For example, if you need to display a name that requires formatting, include {{formatted_name}} rather than {{formatName(unformatted_name)}}. 

Prefer to use Angular's @for syntax rather than *ngFor. 

Do not use 'id' fields unless that id will be explicitly referenced within the code.

Use snake-case for CSS class and style names

When styling elements that are drawn from the Angular Material library, we angular materials default styling as much as possible. Do not use ::ng-deep to override styles.
