href="#why-we-made-adacad" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why We Made AdaCAD" title="Direct link to Why We Made AdaCAD">​</a></h2>
<p>AdaCAD was originally conceived of in a grant to the National Science Foundation that Laura Devendorf submitted in 2017. The grant discussed a vision for computer aided design tool that could be used to design circuitry within cloth structures. The grant was awarded and the first iteration of AdaCAD was developed by then PhD student Mikhaila Friske with support from Shanel Wu.</p>
<p>The vision for a computer aided design tools for e- or smart textiles weaving was inspired by observations made during Laura&#x27;s PhD studies. Specifically, she focused her dissertation on how and why humans might want to be involved in digital fabrication workflows <a href="http://beingthemachine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(For curious readers, this project was called Being the Machine)</a>. At the end of her PhD, she had an opportunity to collaboration with a Google ATAP project focused on woven electronics called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObSFfdfe7I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Jacquard</a>. It was during collaboration and in discussions with <a href="https://www.angryspinner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Jen, the Angry Spinner&quot;</a> who was responsible for weaving our prototypes that Laura discovered woven structures, saw what they were capable of and began see looms as fabrication equipment that had been overlooked in research.</p>
<p>With this ideas fresh in mind, Laura started a faculty position at the University of Colorado Boulder and established her research lab, the Unstable Design Lab. She bought a tapestry loom, then a cricket loom (generously donated by Barry and Jane Schacht), and then a Baby Wolf loom and taught herself to weave using <a href="https://harrisville.com/products/learning-to-weave-by-deborah-chandler?srsltid=AfmBOork5VfvoWlVWE1OlHnCvNvimqTJxnU-KGIFbvIwsgO1tkq-IIU1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deborah Chandler&#x27;s Learning to Weave</a>. Friend, weaver and colleague Steven Frost was a huge inspiration and support during this phase, often coming to the rescue when the warp exploded in tangles and planting the idea in her head to get a TC2. In tandem, she and PhD students Mikhaila Friske and Shanel Wu tried their hand at weaving circuits by recreating examples on <a href="https://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=6005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kobakant</a>. In parallel, the three of them interviewed other e- and smart textiles designers to learn more about their process and workflow and we combined all of those insights into the very first iteration of AdaCAD, which resembled a traditional point paper editor with some specific supports for e- and smart textiles like viewing specific yarn paths, specifying conductive yarns, and designing in different layers. You can read more about this in the resulting publication <a href="/docs/about/">AdaCAD: Crafting Software for Smart Textile Design</a>.</p>
<p>The project continued with support of a second grant that looked to advance the software alongside a residency program intended to foster collaboration between weavers and engineers <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1943109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NSF Grant #1943109</a>. We continued working with this version of AdaCAD for the next year or two and began to see some limitations of the design. Feedback from Members of the Rocky Mountain Handweavers Guild  who tried it expressed that it wasn&#x27;t offering anything more than existing tools such as WeavePoint or iWeaveIt. At the same time, Laura and others in the lab (including now <a href="/docs/about/">Sasha de Koninck</a> and multitalented undergraduate researcher <a href="/docs/about/">Emma Goodwill</a>) became more advanced weavers and began to see that the challenge in developing robust e- textiles was not the integration of a metal yarn, but a deeper understanding of the mechanics that different weave structures afford. During a meeting to discuss the AdaCAD project with Belinda Rose and Vibeke Vestby, Belinda described how she used a tool called <a href="http://www.proweave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProWeave</a>, which had a drag-and-drop style of generating drafts. This meeting shifted Laura to see a new possibility for the software, one that diverged from the point-paper approach to design to think about how a designer might &quot;grow&quot; drafts by connecting different draft manipulating components. This resonated with the way that Laura conceptualized and designed drafts, which always saw the relationships of interlacements or bindings in a cloth as specific algorithmic manipulations (e.g. a twill is a pick that is continually shifted to the right or left, two faced twill can be created by interlacing a twill and its inverse, shifting the inverse draft a few ends ot the left or right to distribute the bindings). With this and during the isolation of the COVID lockdown, Laura began to prototype and develop this vision, ultimately leading to AdaCAD 3.0.</p>
<p>Concurrently, the Unstable Design Lab continued running it&#x27;s Experimental Weaving Residency and Laura and the AdaCAD became more knowledgeable of the practices and approaches of advanced weavers. These weavers in residence were incredible resources in inspiring the design. Specifically Etta Sandry helped us envision new features to create samplers. As we presented the new design, we also received stronger feedback from the community. For instance, weavers like Kathryn Walters and Marianne Fairbanks became involved with the project and spent hours that could extend their practices in new ways or help them integrate AdaCAD into their process. These collaborations and the new design approach are also outlined in a publication called <a href="/docs/about/">AdaCAD: How Parametric Design...</a></p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD_Documentation/tree/main/docs/about/history.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_JAkA"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#why-we-made-adacad" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Why We Made AdaCAD</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 Unstable Design Lab, Inc.
