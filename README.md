# AdaCAD
AdaCAD is a collection of resources for algorithmically generating and manipulating woven drafts. This collection current consists of the following resources: 

- [AdaCAD Library (adacad-drafting-lib)](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD/packages/adacad-drafting-lib): contains the core data structures and algorithms for draft making and manipulating. This includes all of the code and documentation for operations **(if you want to make your own operation, do it in this library!)**. The library also contains the code to render drafts for simulation. Written as a typescript library that is also hosted on as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adacad-drafting-lib). 

- [AdaCAD UI](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD/projects/ui): An Angular project that imports the local AdaCAD library and offers a series of components and features for managing the user interface. This includes a graph of relationships between on-screen operations and drafts, integrations with the user database, and functions for loading and saving files.The UI offers an experimental workspace that applies parametric design to the domain of weave drafting. It supports algorithmic and playful approaches to developing woven structures and cloth, for shaft and jacquard looms. Use it online at [https://adacad.org/](https://adacad.org/).

- [AdaCAD Docs ](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD/projects/docs): A Docusaurus project that imports the AdaCAD library and creates components and markdown pages that document the operations. It also includes additional documentation, examples, and getting started guides. Available at [https://docs.adacad.org](https://docs.adacad.org/)

- [AdaCAD Screenshot Generator ](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD/projects/screenshot-generator): A project that renders each AdaCAD operations in the UI and creates an image of the result. These images can be used to keep the documentation for each operation up to date. 


We invite anyone interested to hack on AdaCAD, should you wish to dive into the code. If that describes you, you can find support by contacting us in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Be7ukQcvrC)
