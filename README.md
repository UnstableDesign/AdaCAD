# AdaCAD
AdaCAD is a collection of resources for algorithmically generating and manipulating woven drafts. This collection current consists 


AdaCAD is an experimental workspace that applies parametric design to the domain of weave drafting. It supports algorithmic and playful approaches to developing woven structures and cloth, for shaft and jacquard looms. Use it online at [https://adacad.org/](https://adacad.org/).

## Related Repositories
The AdaCAD Project is comprised of a collection of different code and documentation resources:

- 🎯 **You are here** [AdaCAD UI Github Repo / @AdaCAD-UI](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD-UI): An Angular project that imports the AdaCAD library and offers a series of components and features for managing the user interface. This includes a graph of relationships between on-screen operations and drafts, integrations with the user database, and functions for loading and saving files.

- [AdaCAD Library Github Repo / @AdaCAD-Library](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD-Library): contains the core data structure and algorithms for draft making and manipulating via parameterized operations. This includes all of the code and documentation for operations. Also contains the code to render drafts for simulation. Written as a typescript library that is also hosted on as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adacad-drafting-lib). 

- [AdaCAD Docs Github Repo / @AdaCAD-Documentation](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD-Documentation): A Docusaurus project that imports the AdaCAD library and creates components and markdown pages that document the projects features as well as tutorials, examples, and getting started guides.
