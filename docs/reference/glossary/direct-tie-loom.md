# Direct Tie Loom / Dobby 

A horizontal loom where each [warp](warp) is threaded through a heddle, and each heddle belongs to one of a given set of frames. When a frame is raised, so too are the heddles and warps within those frames. 

In a direct-tie or dobby loom, each shaft is attached to a lever and a or semi-automated  or  process is to lift and lower the shafts, using the levers, in different combinations.
