# Drawdown

We use the term drawdown to describe the part of the [draft](draft) that represents the [structure](structure) of the resulting cloth. 

A single cell in the drawdown represents a location at which the [warp](warp) and [weft](weft) cross.

When interpreted on a [loom](loom), each black cell represents a place where the loom lifts the warp [end](end) (allowing the weft [pick](pick) to travel under that warp). We refer to this movement as a "[warp raised](warp-raised)." In white cells, the weft is left lowered, allowing the weft to travel over the warp end. We refer to this as a "[warp-lowered](warp-lowered)" cell.

## A note to experienced drafters
We use the drawdown as the default draft representation in AdaCAD. 

You can view the associated threading, tie-up, and treadling diagrams by changing your default loom type and opening the draft detail viewer, or, using operations that generates new "drawdowns" each of which corresponds to the pattern used in your threading, tie-up, and treadling.
