## Language Choice

AdaCAD is ultimately a tool for constructing woven [drafts](./draft). When developing this project, we found ourselves questioning which language to use in our design: the language of programming (which sees a draft as a grid of cells) or the language of [looms](./loom) and [cloth](./cloth) (which sees a draft as a list of instructions for a human-machine to perform). In the end, we decided to use a mix of all languages, but, whenever possible, to stick to the following commitments:

1. To describe drafts from the perspective of what the loom will be doing (e.g. heddle lift or lower) 
2. Whenever possible, maintain the primacy of the material in what will ultimately be woven. Specifically, not to claim that the draft is the final form the cloth will take, but instead, is a set of instructions which materials will animate to different effects.
