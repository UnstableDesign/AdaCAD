# Draft

A draft is an abstract representation of a [cloth](cloth). For example, the two images below show the correspondence between a simulated cloth and the draft that would be used to create the cloth. 

The draft is a form of notation that describes the structure of the cloth. Each square in the draft (which we call a draft cell), represents a location at which a single [warp](warp) [end](end) and [weft](weft) [pick](pick) cross.

## Parts of A Draft

In AdaCAD, a Draft contains several related pieces of information. 


### Drawdown
![file](./img/drawdown.png)

The [drawdown](drawdown) describes the cloth [structure](structure) and the specific way that each warp will travel over each weft. A drawdown may represent an entire piece of cloth, or, a structure that might repeat in one section of the cloth. 


### Weft Materials

The row of cells on the side of the drawdown indicate correspond to different materials that will be used within the [weft](weft). The color of the cell can change to describe the color or type of yarn to be used on each [pick](pick). 


### Warp Materials

The row of cells on the top of the drawdown correspond the different materials that will be used within the [warp](warp). The color of the cell can change to describe teh color or type of yarn to be used on each warp [end](end). 


### Weft Systems

The letters on side of the drawdown indicate the [weft system](weft-system) each [pick](pick) is associated with. You can learn more about how and why you would use weft systems [here](weft-systems). 


### Warp Systems

The letters on top of the drawdown indicate the [warp system](warp-system) that this [end](end) is associated with. You can learn more about how and why you would use warp systems [here](weft-system).
