# Warp Raised

Another way to refer to black cells in a [drawdown](drawdown). We use this term to highlight the relationship between cells in a [drawdown](drawdown) and actions on a loom. Specifically, it tells us that a black cell is a location where the warp [end](end) is raised. This is in contrast to white cells, which describe locations where the  “[warp is lowered](warps-lowered)”. 

This terminology becomes used when describing [parameters](parameter) within an AdaCAD [operation](operation). For instance, when describing a twill, you are asked to specify the number of warps raised and lowered on the first pic in order to describe the overall structure.
