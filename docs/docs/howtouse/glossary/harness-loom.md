# Harness Loom

A horizontal loom where each [warp](warp) is threaded through a heddle, and each heddle belongs to one of a given set of frames. When a frame is raised, so too are the heddles and warps within those frames. 

We use the term "harness" loom to represent looms that control the lifting and lowering of shafts using a tie-up and treadling systems, where-by foot pedals are attached to different sets of shafts and pressed in sequence to result in different cloth patterns.
