# Make A Draft for the TC2

AdaCAD an be a bit strange for those used to Photoshop and the Woven Pixel because instead of making a blank canvas and filling it with our structures, you start from the structures and "grow" them into the size of the canvas/loom that you are working with. In this video, we do this by using the "rectangle" and "selvedge" functions.
