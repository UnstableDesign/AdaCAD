# val

This returns a copy of the current state as an array of numbers

## Parameters
- none


## Returns
an array of numbers

## Implementation

```
let seq = new Sequence.OneD([0,0,1,1])
let a = seq.val()
```

After calling seq.val(), the variable a would hold the array [0, 0, 1, 1] where seq would still hold the Sequence.OneD object.
