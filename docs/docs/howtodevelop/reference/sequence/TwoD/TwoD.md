# Sequence.TwoD
A TwoD Sequence holds a two dimensional array, similar to that of [drawdown](../../drawdown/), however, storing numbers instead of Cell objects. This offers a flexible format for building drafts. For example, OneD objects can be added to TwoD objects as either rows/wefts or columns/warps. 


```jsx title="src/app/core/model/sequence.js"

const seq: Sequence.TwoD = new Sequence.TwoD();

```
