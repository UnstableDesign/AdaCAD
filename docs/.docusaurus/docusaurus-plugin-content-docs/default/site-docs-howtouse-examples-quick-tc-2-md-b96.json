  "description": "AdaCAD an be a bit strange for those used to Photoshop and the Woven Pixel because instead of making a blank canvas and filling it with our structures, you start from the structures and \"grow\" them into the size of the canvas/loom that you are working with. In this tutorial, we do this by using the twill, rectangle and selvedge functions. After designing out draft, we'll export it as a bitmap image and reformat it so that it works with the TC2's interface.",
