  "description": "The Sequence class allows you to create a 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional object and modify its contents. We created this class to streamline the process of procedurally generating drawdowns based on a limited set of rules and manipulations. We wrote mostly because, writing \"createCell()\" explicitly for every cell in a drawdown becomes tedious. Sequence lets you create structural patterns in a flexible manner by chaining sequences of actions together to \"grow\" the specific draft you need.",
