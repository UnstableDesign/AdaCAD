  "description": "Another way to refer to black cells in a drawdown. We use this term to highlight the relationship between cells in a drawdown and actions on a loom. Specifically, it tells us that a black cell is a location where the warp end is raised. This is in contrast to white cells, which describe locations where the  “warp is lowered”.",
