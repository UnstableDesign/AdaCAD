  "description": "Drafts in AdaCAD are containers for both a drawdown as well as information that can be used to interpret the drawdown. Each draft is assigned a unique ID id and will get a name generated by the operations that produced the draft, refered to by genname. Alternatively there can be a user defined name for the draft uddraft. The drawdown drawdown contains the draft cells as a two-dimensional array of Cells. The final values store information about which systems and materials are to be used on each row.",
