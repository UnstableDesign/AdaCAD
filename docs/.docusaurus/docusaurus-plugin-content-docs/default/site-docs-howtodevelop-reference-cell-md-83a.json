  "description": "This is a single cell or square within the draft. Unlike typical drafting where a cell can be either marked black, to raised a heddle at the cell's location, and white if it is left lowered, AdaCAD Cells can hold three values: heddle-up, heddle-down, or unset. An unset heddle is functionally the same as a heddle down, but it can be used to indicate to the weaver that a weft yarn will not be used at this location, for instance, when shape weaving or using supplemental wefts that do not span the entire cloth width.",
