  "description": "A loom simply holds information about the threading, tieup and treadling that can be used to generate a particular drawdown. threading is an array the same size as there are numbers of warps. Each value in the array is a number, corresponding to the frame upon which this warp will be threaded through. The indexing for the threading begins at 0 and increases to support the total number of frames required. treadling is an array the same size as there are numbers of wefts. Each value in the array is a number, corresponding to the treadle to press. The indexing for the threading begins at 0 and increases to support the total treadles of frames required. The tieup is a 2D array of boolean values representing if the treadle in the column is tied to the row corresponding to the frame.",
