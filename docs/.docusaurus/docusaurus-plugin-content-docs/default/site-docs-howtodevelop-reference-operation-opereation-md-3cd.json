  "description": "Operations perform computations upon a draft. They are the core of AdaCAD, as they can be combined and arranged to \"grow\" different kinds of drafts. Operations each contain a set of data, which the software can interpret into an on screen element the user can add to their data flow. Each operation has a name which must be a unique name that is only used internally to locate this specific operation. old_names is a field I made when the name changes or when you no longer want to support an old operation and want to load this operation instead.",
