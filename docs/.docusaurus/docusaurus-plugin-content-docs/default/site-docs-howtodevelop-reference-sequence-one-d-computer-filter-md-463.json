  "description": "This function performs boolean algebra on the sequence in relationship to a second sequence. The specific boolean algebra operation is determined by an input string. To perform the algebra, it compares the values at each index of the array, and updates the sequence at that index with the resulting value. matchSize is called within this function to ensure the two sequences are always the same size.",
