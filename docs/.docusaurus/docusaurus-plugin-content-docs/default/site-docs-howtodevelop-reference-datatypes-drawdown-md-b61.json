  "description": "A drawdown is a type that just simply refers to the 2D array used to store the pattern that will be translated to the loom. The drawdown is used as the primary representation within a draft in AdaCAD. Different Loom objects can take a drawdown as input and create the corresponding threading, tieup and treadling required to produce that drawdown.",
