# Harness Loom

A horizontal loom on which each [warp](warp) yarn is threaded through a heddle, and each heddle belongs to one of a given set of "harnesses" or frames. When a harness is raised, so too are the heddles and warps within those frames. 

We use the term "harness" loom to represent looms that control the lifting and lowering of shafts using a tie-up and treadling system, where-by foot pedals are attached to different sets of shafts and pressed in sequence to result in different cloth patterns.
