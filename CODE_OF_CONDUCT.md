# Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct is a very lightly adapted version of the code of conduct developed and used within the [p5.js project](https://p5js.org/code-of-conduct/) community.

---

The AdaCAD community gathers people with many different backgrounds and forms of expertise. We are open-minded and experimental. Please be mindful of your language and always be curious and supportive for those who may not be as knowledgable as you in a particular subject. 

Any of the following behavior is unacceptable: 
- Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
Threats of violence

- Deliberate intimidation

- Sexually explicit or violent material that is not contextualized and preceded by a considerate warning

- Unwelcome sexual attention

- Stalking or following

- Or any other kinds of harassment

Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.

Be respectful. Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else’s thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.

Be considerate. Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community.

Be open minded. Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing unstabledesignlab@gmail.com. Please include your name and a description of the incident, and we will get back to you ASAP.

Sometimes, participants violating the Code of Conduct are unaware that their behavior is harmful, and an open conversation clears things up to move forward. However, if a participant continues with the behavior, the AdaCAD team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all AdaCAD community spaces.
